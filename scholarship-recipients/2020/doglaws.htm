              <h4 class="h3 border">Classification of nuisance dangerous, and vicious dogs</h4>




<p>Effective May 22, 2012, the state of Ohio no longer defines a &quot;breed of dog commonly known as a pit bull&quot; as a vicious dog. However, any dog may be designated as vicious, dangerous or a nuisance based on its actions. Any law enforcement officer, dog warden or animal control officer may make this designation.</p>

<h3>Nuisance Dog</h3>

<p>Ohio Revised Code Section 955.11</p>

<p>Any dog that without provocation has approached a person in a menacing fashion or in an apparent attitude of attack while off the owner, keeper, or harborer&#39;s property.</p>

<p>Without provocation means that the dog was not teased, tormented or abused by a person; or that the dog was not coming to the aid or defense of a person who was not engaged in illegal or criminal activity, and who was not using the dog as a means of carrying out such activity.</p>

<p>Menacing fashion means that the dog would cause any person being chased or approached to reasonably believe that the dog will cause physical injury to the person.</p>

<p>The penalty for failing to properly confine a Nuisance Dog is a minor misdemeanor, and carries a fine of up to $150. Subsequent offenses are a fourth degree misdemeanor and carry a fine of up to $250 and 30 days imprisonment. If the same dog has been convicted of three or more Nuisance violations, the designation is elevated to Dangerous Dog.</p>

<h3>Dangerous Dog</h3>

<p>Ohio Revised Code Section 955.11</p>

<p>Any dog that without provocation has subject to division (A)(1)(b) of section 955.11 done any of the following while on or off the owner, keeper or harborer&#39;s property.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Caused injury to a person, other than killing or seriously injuring a person</li>
	<li>Killed another dog</li>
	<li>Been the subject of a third or subsequent violation of 955.22C</li>
</ul>

<p>The penalty for failing to properly confine and control a Dangerous Dog is a fourth degree misdemeanor, and carries a fine of up to $250 and 30 days imprisonment. Subsequent offenses are considered a third degree misdemeanor and carry a fine of up to $500 and 60 days imprisonment.</p>

<h3>Vicious Dog</h3>

<p>Ohio Revised Code Section 955.11</p>

<p>Any dog that has seriously injured or killed a person while on or off the owner, keeper or harborer&#39;s property.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Police dogs that kill or seriously injure a person while being used to assist law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties are excluded.</li>
	<li>A dog that kills or seriously injures a person while that person is committing or attempting to commit a trespass or other criminal offense on the property of the owner, harboror or keeper of the dog is excluded.</li>
</ul>

<p>The penalty for failing to properly confine and control a Vicious Dog is a first degree misdemeanor, and carries a fine of up to $1,000 and 180 days imprisonment. If a person is killed, the charge is a fourth degree felony with a maximum fine of $5,000 and 18 months imprisonment.</p>

<p>Serious injury means any of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death.</li>
	<li>Any physical harm that involves a permanent incapacity, either partial or total; or a temporary substantial incapacity.</li>
	<li>Any physical harm that involves a permanent disfigurement, or a temporary serious disfigurment.</li>
	<li>Any physical harm that involves acute pain of a duration that results in substantial suffering, or any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.</li>
</ul>

&nbsp;
<p>Ohio Revised Code Section 955.22E(1)(2)</p>

<p>In addition to properly confining your dog, you are also required to obtain a dangerous dog tag from the county auditor&#39;s office within 30 days of the final designation, and to display it on your dog&#39;s collar at all times. The dangerous dog tag is an additional $50 annual fee, payable to the county auditor in addition to the standard annual dog license. Contact the Franklin County Auditor&#39;s Office at 525-3260 for additional requirements to register a dangerous dog.</p>

<p>The penalty for failure to display a dangerous dog tag is a fourth degree misdemeanor on a first offense with a $250 maximum fine and 30 days imprisonment.</p>

<p>Owners of dogs that are designated as vicious must maintain at least $100,000 of liability insurance coverage on these animals. Owners of dangerous dogs may also be required to maintain at least $100,000 of liability insurance coverage if ordered to do so by the court.</p>

<p>The penalty for failure to insure a dangerous dog tag is a minor misdemeanor with a $150 maximum fine.</p>
