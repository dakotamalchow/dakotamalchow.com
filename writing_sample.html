                <p>For an example of my writing, please follow this link to a paper I wrote concerning the teaching of foreign languages in American high schools.</p>
                <a href="http://dmalchow.wixsite.com/chineseinschools">Chinese as a Foreign Language in American Public Schools</a>
                <p>I decided to write on a topic that there has not been enough discussion about. Many people look to learn a foreign language for the wrong reasons and even though most schools teach foreign language, it is not necessarily the right one that it should be teaching. Throughout the website, I address the problems with learning a new language today and discuss the right way to go about it. I also offer some general advice about setting up a system for new language programs in schools.</p>
