        <br />
        <p>I am currently a senior at Ball State University. I am majoring in Telecommunications with a concentration in Emerging Media and am minoring in Computer Science. I am currently one of the directors and editors for Studio G, a student group that specializes in making informational videos about German culture and language (Studio G's YouTube page).</p>
        <br />
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal computer programming projects and reading and watching videos about programming techniques. I am a tech-savvy person interested in business, educationn, and digital media. I would enjoy working in a job that focuses on web-based and/or mobile development.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I am currently employed at Outfitter, a wholesale screen-print and embroidery shop in Muncie, and Dragoo Auction in Alexandria, Indiana. I have worked at Outfitter and at Dragoo's for the past year and a half. I have both of these jobs to thank for teaching and allowing me to develop skills in customer service, management, and leadership.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I take pride in my abilities to be both technical and meticulous as well as creative and inspiring. I would rather try to first figure out a solution to a problem myself than simply ask for an answer. I enjoy learning about something new and look for opportunities to teach myself something useful everyday.</p>
