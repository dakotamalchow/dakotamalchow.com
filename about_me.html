            <p>Hi! My name is Dakota Malchow. I am a Ball State University graduate. I have an enthusiasm for computer programming, both front and back end. I am currently working as a software engineer, but am always looking for side projects and new opportunities to expand by skills.</p>
	    <br />
	    <p>I take pride in my abilities to be both technical and meticulous as well as creative and inspiring. I would rather try to first figure out a solution to a problem myself than simply ask for an answer. I enjoy learning about something new and look for opportunities to teach myself something useful everyday.</p>
