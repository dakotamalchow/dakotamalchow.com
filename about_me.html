            <br />
            <p>Hi! My name is Dakota Malchow. I am a Telecommunications Major and a Computer Science Minor with a concentration in Emerging Media.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I am currently striving for a full time position in software or web development. I work on client websites and personal computer programming projects in my spare time. I am a tech-savvy person also interested in business, educationn, and digital media.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I am currently employed at Outfitter, a wholesale screen-print and embroidery shop in Muncie, and Dragoo Auction in Alexandria, Indiana. I have worked at Outfitter and at Dragoo's for the past two years. I have both of these jobs to thank for teaching and allowing me to develop skills in customer service, management, and leadership.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I take pride in my abilities to be both technical and meticulous as well as creative and inspiring. I would rather try to first figure out a solution to a problem myself than simply ask for an answer. I enjoy learning about something new and look for opportunities to teach myself something useful everyday.</p>
