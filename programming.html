                <p>My final semester of my undergrad, I am enrolled in a Computer Science immersive learning class. Our goal was to make a game that would be published on the Muncie Sanitary District website. This game was based on Prairie Creek Reservoir and featured geolocative aspects such as those in 'Pokemon Go'.</p>
