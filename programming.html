        <p>I am currently in the process of refactoring some old code so that it will fit my new standards of programming. After reading Robert Martin's book, Clean Code, I learned a lot about how to write more efficient code that will be easier to read, hold up better over time, and withstand great changes made to other parts of the code. Clean Code also talks a great deal of how to correctly write Object Oriented systems as well as classes and methods.</p>
        <p>An example of some of my "clean code" can be found at <a href="https://github.com/cs222-fall-2016/twp-dpgreenway-dmalchow">this link to a GitHub repository</a>. This is a class project completed with another student. This Wikipedia Live Data Analyzer program allows a user to look up changes made in real time on Wikipedia as well as the user that made those changes.</p>
        <p>I am currently working with two other students on completely an Android app called "Super Smash Stat Tracker". This app will allow a user to create a custom experience to allow them to locally store data about matches they have won while playing Super Smash Bros. The user will have the ability to choose the game version, character, opponent, and stage they are playing and specify whether they have won or loss. They will also be able to view to see what attributes they are most successful with. </p>
